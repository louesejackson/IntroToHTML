                sections have a heading.

                    Orbiting  this  at  a  distance  of  roughly  ninety
                    -­‐
                    two  million  miles  is  an
                    utterly  insignificant  little  blue  green  planet  whose  ape
                    -­‐
                    descended  life
                    forms  are  so  amazingly  primitive  that  they  still  think  digital  watches
                    are  a  pretty  neat  idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This  plan
                    et  has
                    ʹ
                    or  rather  had
                    ʹ
                    a  problem,  which  was  this:  most
                    of  the  people  on  it  were  unhappy  for  pretty  much  of  the  time.  Many
                    solutions  were  suggested  for  this  problem,  but  most  of  these  were
                    largely  concerned  with  the  movements  of  small  green  pieces  of  pape
                    r,
                    which  is  odd  because  on  the  whole  it  wasn't  the  small  green  pieces  of
                    paper  that  were  unhappy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And  so  the  problem  remained;  lots  of  the  people  were  mean,  and
                    most  of  them  were  miserable,  even  the  ones  with  digital  watches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many  were  increasingly  of  th
                    e  opinion  that  they'd  all  made  a  big
                    mistake  in  coming  down  from  the  trees  in  the  first  place.  And  some
                    said  that  even  the  trees  had  been  a  bad  move,  and  that  no  one  should
                    ever  have  left  the  oceans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And  then,  one  Thursday,  nearly  two  thousand  years  after
                    one  man
                    had  been  nailed  to  a  tree  for  saying  how  great  it  would  be  to  be  nice
                    to  people  for  a  change,  one  girl  sitting  on  her  own  in  a  small  cafe  in
                    Rickmansworth  suddenly  realized  what  it  was  that  had  been  going
                    wrong  all  this  time,  and  she  finally  knew
                    how  the  world  could  be
                    made  a  good  and  happy  place.  This  time  it  was  right,  it  would  work,
                    and  no  one  would  have  to  get  nailed  to  anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly,  however,  before  she  could  get  to  a  phone  to  tell  anyone
                    about  it,  a  terribly  stupid  catastrophe  occurred,  an
                    d  the  idea  was  lost
                    forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This  is  not  her  story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But  it  is  the  story  of  that  terrible  stupid  catastrophe  and  some  of  its
                    consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It  is  also  the  story  of  a  book,  a  book  called  The  Hitch  Hiker's  Guide
                    to  the  Galaxy.

                    The idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armour to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the fact that it was he, by peddling second rate technology, led them into it in the first place, and continues to do so today.

                    Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, "This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, may have been made to have me in it!" This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. We all know that at some point in the future the Universe will come to an end and at some other point, considerably in advance from that but still not immediately pressing, the sun will explode. We feel there's plenty of time to worry about that, but on the other hand that's a very dangerous thing to say.
